	marc2csv

version 1.0

by Vince Weaver	<vince@deater.net>

Usage:
	./marc2csv < 000001.marc


This tool will take a MARC formatted book entry and convert it
to a line of CSV suitable for importing into a spreadsheet.

This was something quickly thrown together, you probably don't
want to use it in production


Backstory
~~~~~~~~~

My family has 5000+ books and we had catloged them into the
EMILDA library software.  However Emilda isn't really supported anymore
and so we lost access to the database.  And it is shockingly hard
to find a good, free, library software.  Especially one where you can
just import an existing set of MARC records.

In any case finally we gave up and I wrote this tool to dump everything
to a spreadsheet, which is certainly the wrong way to do things but
it's certainly better than nothing.
